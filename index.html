    <h1> What constitutes a creative web project today?</h1>
    <p> I believe a creative project can be something that is created without a certain construct  whether it is data visualization, animation, photography, etc. Creativity can be endless on the web just as it is in reality.</p>

      <h1>How do you wish to employ the web or internet as a creative platform?</h1>
    <p> I want to use my website as a portfoilio to showcase the different creativity aspects that I feel comfortable in whether it is writing or photography.</p>

    <h1> What are your goals in this course?</h1>
    <p> I want to push myself to learn things that I consider challenging and complex and become more comfortable with approaching web design.</p>
